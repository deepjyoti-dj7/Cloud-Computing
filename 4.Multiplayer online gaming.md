# 🎮 Cloud Computing in Multiplayer Online Gaming

Cloud computing has revolutionized **multiplayer online gaming** by offering a scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance infrastructure that enhances player experience and game development.

## ☁️ What is Cloud Gaming?

**Cloud gaming**, also known as **gaming on demand**, is a form of online gaming where games are **streamed from remote servers** instead of being installed on the user’s device.  
Players can play high-end games anytime, anywhere, using devices such as **computers, mobiles, and tablets**.

### 🎮 Types of Cloud Gaming

1. **Video Streaming-Based Cloud Games:**  
   The game runs entirely on a remote server, and the player interacts with it through a live video stream.

2. **File Streaming-Based Cloud Games:**  
   Only necessary parts of the game are downloaded or streamed as the player progresses.

Cloud gaming removes device limitations by **offloading heavy processing and graphics rendering** to powerful cloud servers.  
Your device simply displays the streamed graphics and sends input commands over the internet.

## ⚙️ How Cloud Gaming Works

In traditional gaming, processing happens on the gamer’s hardware (like PCs or consoles).  
But in **cloud gaming**, all processing, rendering, and input handling happen on **remote servers** located in data centers.

The **cloud server**:

- Runs the game
- Processes user inputs
- Streams real-time video output back to the player’s screen

This makes it possible to play even high-end games on low-powered devices, as long as there is a stable internet connection.
