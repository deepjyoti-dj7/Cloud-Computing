## ☁️ What is Cloud Gaming?

**Cloud gaming**, also known as **gaming on demand**, is a type of online gaming where the game runs on a **remote server** rather than the player’s local device.  
Players receive a **video stream** of the game over the internet and send back their inputs in real time.

This means even high-end games can run smoothly on low-powered devices such as mobiles, tablets, or regular PCs — as long as the internet connection is strong.

### 🕹️ Types of Cloud Gaming

1. **Video Streaming-Based Gaming:**  
   The entire game runs on the server, and players interact with it through video streams.
2. **File Streaming-Based Gaming:**  
   The game downloads or streams only necessary data as the player progresses.

## ⚙️ How Cloud Gaming Works

Traditionally, games rely on **local hardware** like consoles or gaming PCs.  
In **cloud gaming**, all heavy tasks — like **processing, rendering graphics, and managing data** — happen on **remote cloud servers**.

These servers:

- Run the game application
- Process user commands instantly
- Send back the live video feed of gameplay

Your device acts only as a **display terminal**, showing the streamed graphics and sending inputs.
