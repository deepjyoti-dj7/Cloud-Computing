## ⚙️ Technical Characteristics

1. **Large-scale Computing Resources**  
   Cloud systems operate on a large scale to reduce costs and achieve economies of scale.

2. **Shared Resource Pooling**  
   Combines virtual and physical resources to enable scalability and location-independent access.

3. **Dynamic Resource Scheduling**  
   Automatically provisions and allocates resources based on user demand through automation.

4. **High Scalability**  
   New servers and nodes can be easily added without reconfiguring existing systems.

5. **Rapid Elasticity**  
   Computing resources can be quickly increased or decreased according to user or application needs.

## 🌐 Basic Characteristics

1. **On-demand Self-service**  
   Users can access and manage services automatically without human interaction.

2. **Broad Network Access**  
   Cloud services are available anytime and anywhere through the internet on devices like laptops or mobiles.

3. **Measured Service**  
   A pay-per-use model where usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on actual consumption.

4. **Multitenancy**  
   Multiple users share the same cloud resources securely and efficiently.

5. **Reliability**  
   Multiple redundant sites ensure continuous service availability and minimize downtime.

6. **Cost-effectiveness**  
   Eliminates the need for expensive hardware and reduces maintenance costs.

7. **Customization**  
   Services, applications, and infrastructure can be configured to meet specific user requirements.

8. **Efficient Resource Utilization**  
   Ensures optimal usage of resources, which are provided only when needed.

9. **Maintainability**  
   Hardware and software maintenance are handled by the cloud provider, reducing user workload.

10. **Collaboration**  
    Enables multiple users to work together seamlessly on shared platforms and applications.

11. **Virtualization**  
    Physical resources are provided virtually, allowing users to access them from anywhere at any time.

12. **Green Technology**  
    Energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, reducing power consumption and waste.

13. **High Performance**  
    Provides powerful computing capabilities and large-scale storage for demanding applications.

14. **Shared Infrastructure**  
    Allows sharing of storage, networking, and computing resources through virtualization.

15. **Network Access**  
    Cloud services are accessed via standard internet protocols like HTTP on any connected device.
