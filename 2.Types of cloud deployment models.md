# ☁️ Types of Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud services are made available to users and who can access them.  
There are **four major deployment models** of cloud computing.

---

## 1. **Public Cloud**

- The cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by third-party providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
- Resources are shared among multiple users over the internet.
- It offers high scalability, cost efficiency, and easy access.
- Example: Gmail, Dropbox, and Amazon Web Services.

---

## 2. **Private Cloud**

- The cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization.
- It can be managed internally or by a third party and can be hosted on-site or externally.
- Provides higher security, privacy, and control.
- Example: Private cloud used by banks or government agencies.

## 3. **Hybrid Cloud**

- Combines features of both public and private clouds.
- Data and applications can move between the two, offering greater flexibility.
- It allows organizations to keep sensitive operations on the private cloud while using the public cloud for general workloads.
- Example: A company using a private cloud for data storage and a public cloud for software testing.

---

## 4. **Community Cloud**

- A shared cloud infrastructure for a specific group or community with common goals or security requirements.
- Managed by one or more organizations or a third party.
- It offers collaborative usage and cost-sharing among participants.
- Example: Universities, research institutions, or healthcare organizations sharing resources.
